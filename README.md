# BlueRidge Theme

A moderately dark theme inspired by mountain landscapes at dawn, combining cool slate grays with warm morning tones, accented by forest greens and mountain streams. This theme embodies the tranquil strength of mountain ridges.

## Design Philosophy: Mountain Serenity

This theme uses a **cool/warm complementary split** color theory:
- **Cool Foundation**: Slate grays and mountain blues evoke stone ridges and morning mist
- **Warm Accents**: Sunrise gold and autumn clay bring warmth and natural beauty
- **Balance**: Mountain streams and forest greens bridge the cool and warm tones
- **Sacred Moments**: Temple gold marks breakthrough insights and important elements

The result is a serene yet vibrant environment that promotes contemplation while maintaining clarity.
